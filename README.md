# DGM / Velmod velocity model extraction

## Description

This module provides functionality to extract seismic velocity profiles (1-D), sections (2-D), cubes (3-D), etc., from the DGM-diep V5 (stratigraphic units) and VELMOD3.1 (P-wave) models.

## Configuration

Package configuration is specified in [config/config.json](config/config.json).
This contains the current URLs of the relevant files.

A python environment can be created using the either pip, using [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) or conda using [environment.yml](environment.yml), i.e.:
```
conda env create --file environment.yml
conda activate dgm_velmod_sampler
```
or:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Download and extraction of the relevant files can be taken care of by the supplied [scripts/configure.py](scripts/configure.py) script.
```
python scripts/configure.py
```
The creation of xarray files representing DGM5 and VELMOD3.1 is taken care of by the [scripts/convert.py](scripts/convert.py) script, which also make use of the [config/config.json](config/config.json) file for the paths.
```
python scripts/convert.py
```
If desired the installation and conversion can be tested with the following command.
```
pytest --cov=.
```
After the above steps, the models can be used, following the examples in [examples/examples.ipnb](examples/examples.ipynb).

## Usage

See [examples/examples.ipnb](examples/examples.ipynb) for usage examples.

## Support

Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap

At some point, the package may include code for the generation of random realizations of velocities within the uncertainty specifications of VELMOD3.1 and the generation of S-wave velocities on the basis of S-to-P relations.

At some point, the package may include the VELMOD 4b velocity models.
